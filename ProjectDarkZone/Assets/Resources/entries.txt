Day 1
Descent was good. Maria and I made 500 ft. If I'm right, the gem should be somewhere within 70 ft of our location. Can't believe this is happening. We'll be rich. I can already hear Maria laughing behind me.
--Ben Lee
Day 1 - Excavation
Today, my colleagues and I will reach a site where an ancient civilization has been discovered below the depths of the earth. Oh, my hands jitter at the thought. A city, an entire city, deep beneath our feet and all this time, none of us have even considered the possibility. Imagine the things that we will discover down there. A new culture, pottery, religion, concepts of good and evil. It has been a long time since mankind has touched something so extraordinary and new since the splitting of the atom. It's time to bring it all to the surface.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 2
Alright, a mishap. Something happened to the climbing rope and one of our lights ran out. No problem. I brought spares. Maria kept tapping my back. Something about being followed. I swear, there is NOTHING in this cave. Just us and the gems.
--Ben Lee
Day 2 - Exploration
It all started with an accident. One of my students was passing by until his foot stumbled upon a hole hidden in the brush. I expected nothing more than a way to a dead-end, but my pessimism was met with something indescribably grand. An entire network of caves. It was enormous. Our readings have shown that these caves measure out to be at least as long as 10 times the Great Wall of China and it's just the first day. I believe I heard something deeper down. It sounded like a girl's voice. No, Kletus. You are getting too senile for your age.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 3
Something's not right. I know the map is correct. I paid a fortune for it. But the cave - it's changed. That corridor we came down from, the stalagmites, everything. Changed. Shifted. We got separated more than I could count. Don't think that way, Matt. The cave is playing tricks on you. It's the dark. Just the dark.
--Ben Lee
Day 3 - Deeper
I may be old for climbing mountains, but this is one mountain I must climb. An inverted mountain, if you will. Our entire team is trembling at the prospect of this. It is like walking through a colossal anthill.  The water must've done this place a good number of stroking and cutting. Now, I know the precautions of deep-earth exploration. Don't stray too far. But my students couldn't help it. They can feel it. I can feel it. This civilization. It's close. It's faint, like lightning at my fingertips. I saw something sparkle in the distance. I marked it on my map. We'll see what it is soon.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 4
Maria's missing.  She was right here.  Right here.  I was practically holding her hand. I looked everywhere.  Our camp, our safe zones, everywhere.  She won't respond.  No light, no echo, not even a trail. It's like she just disappeared. No, I didn't look everywhere. I didn't look down there.  Deeper.  I need to go deeper.
--Ben Lee
Day 4 - Discovery
A gem.  A green gem in the palm of my hand.  Jacob, my prized gemologist, measured its content and I could not forget the man's face.  He said that this gem was five times the worth of the Hope Diamond.  He said and I quote, "This might as well be a shard of the fictitious Cintamani Stone." All my students touched it once.  They act as if they've found everything down here.  Oh, no no no.  We are just getting started.  A gem was the start.  If we found one, we can find more. And perhaps, this lost city. I was worried for my friend, Jacob.  He kept looking at the gem with this hungry expression.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 5
Rope snapped.  Bone broken.  It hurts.  God, it hurts. My light's still working.  Got a few flares and matches left. I think something's down here with me.
--Ben Lee
Day 5 - Loss
Jacob has gone missing.  And not just that, the stone has too.  It was right there in my safe when we returned to the surface. There were all these scratch marks at the side of the metal box.  Did he claw his way into the contents?  Everything else was untouched - money, manuscripts, my gun. Well, of course, the gem is priceless when he measured it, so it is little wonder why anyone would want it.  But Jacob?  No, I know Jacob.  He's a quiet man. My men have returned.  They saw they saw footprints leading into the caves. We'll go after him.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 6
Nothing. Nothing. Maria won't answer me.  I call for her and I just hear an echo. What was it she said to me?  Something in the cave with us?  No, she was just scared. There is nothing.  NOTHING out there.  With me. The dark is so thick down here. It's getting thicker.
--Ben Lee
Day 6 - Twisted
We've spent an entire day looking for Jacob. This cave, so filled with twists and turns.  I've never seen a more complicated array of tunnels. Something's not right.  No, I marked and drew these tunnels exactly as I saw them days ago.  But the left turn that was here is no longer here. There was a drop 500 meters back, but even that has disappeared. It's like the entire cave has changed. No, Kletus.  You imbecile, you never draw things incorrectly.  Jacob must've tinkered with your journals when you slept.  It's the only explanation. Yes. We'll find him.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 7
It's Maria. I see her.  She's always there, right there.  Just outside my light. Why won't she turn around?  It's me, Matt. She looks different. Almost shapeless.
--Ben Lee
Day 7- Cut off
The worst has happened.  Our way back has been blocked off.  I don't know how, but only after that quake did everything become vaguely clear.  Our darkest luck, an earthquake beneath the earth. Now an entire slab of rock has cut our way back to safety, to food and water and additional assistance. Our radios have been crushed save for mine and another student's.  We'll have to make do.  We need to find Jacob and another way out. Half the team with stay here with the students and try to establish contact. Come on, Kletus.  You must be strong now.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 8
I didn't want to admit it.  There is SOMETHING down here with me. I hear hissing, scratching, and gnawing.  It's very close, like over my shoulder.  But I turn and see nothing there.  What's going on? Light.  My light is growing weaker. It's just Maria.  She's playing tricks on me.  She's right here.  With me. Last light left.
--Ben Lee
Day 8 - Darker
My watch has broken.  I don't know if a day has passed or not.  So I might as well not write it at all. It's getting darker now.  Harder to breathe too.  It's like going deeper into an ocean where the water you can breathe, but the pressure.  I saw something in the distance.  A twinkle.  Jacob, it had to be Jacob.  I called out to him, but he never answered back.  Two of my men went out to apprehend the fool. They never came back. The twinkle disappeared too.
-- Professor Kletus
Day 9
Light is out. So dark. Maria is coming for me. We'll be together. Forever down here.
--Ben Lee
Day 9 - Lost
I don't know who you are.  I don't know what you want down here.  But I'll have you know that it's been years since I first came here.  Everything down here is mine. I came down here looking for a city. And it's now crowned me king.  The gems are so beautiful.  The walls are so alive. If you touch anything, I will come for you. For the Shapeless One.
-- Professor Kletus
